application randomly freezes

-fixed
yes
-how to reproduce
span requests when logged in (eg login, hold F5 on /emails)
-comments
seems to be caused by the one server (Mongrel) process unable to process concurrent connections

reduced the impact by using Pratik Naik's mongrel patch, but without concurrent MySQL connections support it still can't reallly be fixed

fix:
added Timeout.timeout to IMAP login code
